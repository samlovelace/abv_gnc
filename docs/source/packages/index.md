# Packages

The ABV software stack is implemented as ROS2 packages with each package handling a primary component, i.e. there is one package for performing guidance, one package for navigation, one package for control and so on.

Each package name begins with the prefix "abv\_" followed by a descriptive word to represent what it does.
