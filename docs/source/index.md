# ABV-GNC Documentation

Welcome to the Air Bearing Vehicle (ABV) software stack documentation! The ABV's are developed and used by [The Autonomy Lab](https://www.theautonomylab.com/) at Florida Tech as a planar spacecraft testbed for various guidance, navigation, control and autonomy algorithms.

The ABV software stack implements the core guidance, navigation, and control
capabilities for the planar spacecraft testbed, along with tools for teleoperation,
visualization, and experimentation.
